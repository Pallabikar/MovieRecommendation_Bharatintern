# MovieRecommendation_Bharatintern

ðŸŽ‰ Excited to share that I have successfully completed Task 2, "Movie Recommendation," during my internship at Bharat Intern! ðŸš€
Leveraging Python, I developed a recommendation system that suggests movies based on user preferences and viewing history. This project allowed me to dive deep into data manipulation, machine learning algorithms, and recommendation engines, which was both challenging and rewarding.
Grateful for this opportunity to enhance my skills and looking forward to tackling the next tasks! ðŸ’»ðŸŽ¥
